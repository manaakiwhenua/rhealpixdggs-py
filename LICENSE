Dual License
=============

This software is dual-licensed under the terms of either:

- GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)
  See LICENSE-LGPL for the full license text

OR

- MIT License
  See LICENSE-MIT for the full license text

You may choose to use, distribute, and/or modify this software under the
terms of either license.

Rationale
---------

The dual licensing approach allows this software to be:

1. Used in open-source projects that prefer copyleft licenses (LGPL-3.0)
2. Integrated into proprietary software and organizational contexts where
   LGPL is not permitted (MIT)

This ensures the widest possible adoption while respecting different
organizational policies, including those of standards bodies like the
Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and companies with LGPL restrictions.

How to Apply This License
--------------------------

When using this software, you must comply with the terms of at least one
of the licenses. You are free to choose which license best suits your needs.

If you redistribute this software, you should include all three license
files (LICENSE, LICENSE-LGPL, and LICENSE-MIT) to preserve the dual
licensing option for downstream users.
